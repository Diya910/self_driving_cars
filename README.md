## üåü Introduction

This project simulates self-driving cars navigating a track using a neural network trained with the **NEAT algorithm**. The simulation is visualized using **Pygame**, a popular Python library for creating games and graphical applications.

### Key Features:
- **NEAT Algorithm**: Evolves neural networks to control the cars.
- **Pygame Visualization**: Real-time visualization of cars navigating the track.
- **Customizable Track**: Easily modify the track or add new ones.
- **Interactive Simulation**: Watch the cars learn and improve over generations.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### NEAT Algorithm
NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a genetic algorithm that evolves neural networks. It starts with simple networks and gradually increases their complexity by adding nodes and connections. The goal is to optimize the network to perform a specific task‚Äîin this case, driving a car around a track.

### Pygame Visualization
Pygame is used to create a graphical interface where you can watch the cars in action. The cars are controlled by the neural networks, and their performance is evaluated based on how far they can drive without crashing.

### Simulation Workflow:
1. **Initialization**: A population of cars with random neural networks is created.
2. **Evaluation**: Each car drives around the track, and its fitness is calculated based on distance traveled and speed.
3. **Selection**: The best-performing cars are selected for reproduction.
4. **Mutation and Crossover**: New generations of cars are created by combining and mutating the neural networks of the best performers.
5. **Repeat**: The process continues until the cars learn to navigate the track effectively.

## ü§î Why NEAT?

NEAT is particularly well-suited for this project because:
- **No Predefined Architecture**: NEAT evolves the structure of the neural network, so you don‚Äôt need to design it manually.
- **Efficient Learning**: It starts with simple networks and gradually increases complexity, making it computationally efficient.
- **Adaptability**: NEAT can adapt to different environments and tasks, making it ideal for training self-driving cars.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Diya910/self_driving_cars.git
cd self_driving_cars
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Manual Installation (if needed):
- **NEAT-Python**: The NEAT algorithm implementation.
  ```bash
  pip install neat-python
  ```
- **Pygame**: For visualization.
  ```bash
  pip install pygame
  ```

## üöÄ Running the Simulation

1. **Start the Simulation**:
   Run the following command to start the simulation:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Watch the Cars Learn**:
   - The simulation will open a Pygame window where you can watch the cars navigate the track.
   - The cars will improve over generations as the NEAT algorithm evolves their neural networks.

3. **Stop the Simulation**:
   Close the Pygame window or press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the simulation.

## üé® Customization

### 1. Modify the Track
You can create your own track by editing the `map.png` file in the repository. Use an image editor to design a new track, ensuring the borders are marked with the color `(255, 255, 255, 255)` (white).

### 2. Adjust NEAT Parameters
The NEAT algorithm's behavior can be customized by editing the `config.txt` file. For example:
- **Population Size**: Increase or decrease the number of cars in each generation.
- **Mutation Rates**: Control how often and how much the neural networks mutate.

### 3. Change Car Behavior
You can modify the car's speed, sensor range, and other parameters in the `Car` class within the code.
